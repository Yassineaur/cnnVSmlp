  <h1>Flying Object Classification</h1>

  <p>This project aims to classify objects based on whether they can fly or not using machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks. The dataset used for this classification task is the CIFAR10 dataset, which consists of images belonging to 10 different classes, including various objects and animals.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Python 3.x</li>
    <li>TensorFlow</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can install the required packages using pip:</p>

  <pre><code>pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn</code></pre>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone this repository to your local machine:</li>
  </ol>

  <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/Yassineaur/CNN_CIFAR-10.git</code></pre>

  <ol start="2">
    <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
  </ol>

  <pre><code>cd CNN_CIFAR-10</code></pre>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. By leveraging CNN architecture and the CIFAR10 dataset, we were able to classify objects based on their ability to fly with high accuracy. The code provided in this repository serves as a starting point for similar classification tasks and can be extended or modified as needed.</p>
